# Deep Learning for Heart Failure Prediction
Arcadia-Northeastern University Research_Capstone
## Research focused on comparing various machine learning models for heart failure prediction using real-world healthcare data.


__Abstract__

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health concern with high mortality and healthcare costs, emphasizing the importance of accurate early prediction. This research explores the application of deep learning models, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (RNN-GRU), and Transformer architectures to predict heart failure risk using patient time-series data. 

Employing real datasets from Arcadia.io, key features are selected. Health measurements include Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Age, Gender, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Demographic information includes unemployment, poverty, and single-parent figures based on geographical areas, and median earnings. These are then processed into a time-series using 1-month, 12-months and 120-month time windows. Area Under the Curve (AUC) is used to evaluate each model's predictive performance. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of RNN-LSTM, RNN-GRU, and Transformer models, this research aims to identify the most effective deep learning architecture in early HF diagnosis. The goal is to reduce morbidity and improve patient outcomes.
